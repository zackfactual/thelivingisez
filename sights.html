        <h2>Things to Do In Northfield</h2>
        <p>Between the woods, the farms, and the historic downtown storefronts, there's plenty to explore in Northfield.  Here are a couple of our favorite local spots.</p>
        <p><a href="riverwalkmarketfair.org" target="_blank">Riverwalk Market</a> - The market runs every Saturday morning in the summertime and features everything from local artists to farmers to pastries and paella.</p>
        <p><a href="https://apps.carleton.edu/campus/arb/" target="_blank">Carleton Arboretum</a> - The Carleton College Arboretum covers 800 acres of prairie and woods.  It has extensive trails and a thriving wildlife population.</p>
        <p><a href="https://wp.stolaf.edu/naturallands" target="_blank">St. Olaf Natural Lands</a> - Across the river, St Olaf College has its own expanse of thriving native ecosystems covering 350 acres, and trails throughout.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/park.html?id=spk00241#homepage" target="_blank">Nerstrand - Big Woods State Park</a> - Located about a twenty-minute drive south of town, the state park has miles of trails running through woods and along a stream.</p>
        <p><a href="http://www.mncider.com/" target="_blank">Keepsake Cidery</a> - With their focus on traditional cider apples and wild ferments, Keepsake is our favorite Minnesota cidery.  On weekends, you can visit their tasting room, and explore the orchard and the woods around it.</p>
        <p><a href="www.northfieldhistory.org" target="_blank">Northfield Historical Society</a> - Northfield was the site of a bank raid by the James-Younger gang in 1876. Visit the bank where the raid took place- now a historical society- to hear the whole story of how the townsfolk drove them off.</p>
