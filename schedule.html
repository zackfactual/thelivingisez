        <h2>Weekend Schedule</h2>
        <h3>Thursday, July 1, 7PM-9PM – Keepsake Cidery</h3>
        <p>Since Zack and Elena first met over a glass of cider, it seems right to start their wedding weekend at a cidery, and we'll be kicking off festivities at Keepsake Cider. Keepsake is Zack and Elena's favorite Minnesota cidery, with an eclectic, delicious mix of heritage, local, and wild-fermented ciders.</p>
        <h3>Friday, July 2, 6PM-10PM – Armory Square Event Center</h3>
        <p>After their rehearsal on Friday, Zack and Elena welcome you to Armory Square Event Center in downtown Northfield for dinner and drinks. We will be serving food from Ansari's Mediterranean Grill & Lounge, a local favorite.</p>
        <h3>Saturday, July 3, 4PM-11PM – The Gardens of Castle Rock</h3>
        <p>Zack and Elena's wedding ceremony will begin at 4PM, and festivities will continue until 11PM, including dinner, dancing, and lawn games.</p>
        <p>A shuttle will run out to the Gardens at 2:45PM, with a second trip leaving at around 3:45.  Pickup will be at 320 3rd St E, at the entrance to Carleton College's Weitz Center for Creativity.</p>
        <p>Shuttles will run back to town once an hour, starting at 8PM, with the last trip leaving at 9PM.</p>
        <p>Please note that guests cannot leave cars at the Gardens overnight.</p>
